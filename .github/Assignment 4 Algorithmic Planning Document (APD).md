Planning your program before you start coding is part of the development process. In this document, you will:

- [ ] Step 1: Write a detailed description of your program  
- [ ] Step 2: Design a sample run with test input and output  
- [ ] Step 3: Algorithm design  
      - [ ] Identify the program inputs and their data types  
      - [ ] Identify the program outputs and their data types  
      - [ ] Identify any calculations or formulas needed  
      - [ ] Identify input/process/output functions and write the algorithmic steps 

1. ## Program Description

In the box below, describe the purpose of the program. You must include a detailed description with at least two complete sentences.

| Program description: |
| :---- |
| In bicycle parts and maintenance the chainring and cog are among the most important componentants along with the seat and pedals. Using the number of teeth on the chainring and cog the gear ratio can be determined. A gear ratio helps identify the rate a rider’s pedaling will match a revolution on the rear wheel. By changing and selecting the appropriate gear cyclists find ease on a multitude of terrain. This program calculates the gear ratio by dividing the number of teeth on the front chainring by the number of teeth on the rear cog. |

2. ## Sample Run

When designing your program, start with a sample run. Imagine a user running your program. What will they see? Identify the expected inputs and the corresponding outputs. Choose test data to validate your program and calculate the expected outputs. Use your sample run to test your program.

3. ## Algorithmic Design

Before you start coding, plan the logic and consider the test data you'll use to verify correctness. Planning before coding saves time and frustration—it's a key practice for all programmers\! Follow the steps below to identify the inputs, outputs, calculations, and steps needed to solve the problem.

| Algorithmic design: |
| :---- |
| Identify and list all of the user input and their data types. You must have at least **three inputs**, and one **must** be a string. I do not recommend having more than five inputs. |
| Options: Int Bike name: string Sprocket: int |
| Identify and list all of the outputs and their data types. |
| chainring\_big: int chainring\_small: int cog\_big: int cog\_small: int gear\_ratio: Float num\_gear: Int |
| What calculations do you need to do to transform inputs into outputs?  List all formulas needed, if applicable. If no calculations are needed, state that there are no calculations for this algorithm.  |
| gear\_ratio \= chainring\_big / cog\_small num\_gear \= chainring\_count \+ cog\_count  |
| Write out the steps the program will perform (number each step 1., 2., etc.). Each step will be translated directly into Python code. **DO NOT use code syntax, think about the steps you would ask someone to follow to solve the problem in conversational words.** |
| `main()` function steps: Init bike\_id as an empty list Init chainring\_list as an empty list Init cog\_list as an empty list Set variable option to 0 Print the introduction function While option is not 4 Print the options list for the user to see Set option to the users input  |
| Other functions (starting with Assignment 2): main(): print\_intro(): Print a welcome message Print menu options get\_option(): Using the int validation method get the users input Return the input get\_bike\_id(): Prompt for and get the bike name or id. Return bike id get\_sprocket(prompt): Print which set of sprockets  input is expecting based on prompt being passed in. Set sprockets to an empty list Get the users first sprocket and set it equal to sprocket. While length of sprockets is 0 If sprocket entered by user is 0 Print error message If sprocket is less than 11 or greater than 75 Print an error for invalid size If sprocket entered by user is a duplicate Print an error for duplicate sprocket size Else  append sprocket to the list of sprockets. Get users input and set it to sprocket While sprocket does not equal 0 If sprocket is less than 11 or greater than 75 Print error for invalid size If sprocket entered by user is a duplicate Print error for duplicate sprocket size Else Insert the sprocket into a list of sprockets in a sorted manner. Get sprocket size from user and set it to sprocket Return the list of sprockets calc\_gear\_ratio(chainring\_max, cog\_min): gear\_ratio \= chainring\_max / cog\_min return gear\_ratio calc\_num\_gear(chainring\_count, cog\_count): num\_gear \= chainring\_count \* cog\_count return num\_gear print\_outro(): Print an exit message Add\_entry Call the bike\_id function and get the users bike id Append the bike\_id to the list of bike\_id’s Call the get\_sprocket function passing in the chainring prompt, returning a list of chainrings. Append the list to the list of chainring lists Call the get\_sprocket function passing in the cog prompt, returning a list of cogs Append the list to the list of cog lists. Process\_lists(bike\_id, chainring\_list, cog\_list) If length of bike\_id is 0  Print error Set index to 0 While index is less than the length of the list of bike\_id’s Call the extract\_bike\_stats function passing in chainring list and cog list, assigning the values returned to chainring\_small, chainring\_large, cog\_small, cog\_big, gear\_ratio, and number of gears. Passing in the return from bike\_stats into print\_bike info print\_bike(bike\_id, chainring\_large, chainring\_small,chainring\_count, cog\_large, cog\_small, cog\_count) Print the info passed from process lists insert\_sorted(list, value) Set i to 0 While i is less than length of list and the list at index i is less than value Insert value at index i Extract\_bike\_stats(chainring\_list, cog\_list) Set chainring small to the smallest of the sprockets in the list Set chainring big to the biggest of the sprockets in the list Set cog small to the smallest of the sprockets in the list Set cog big to the biggest of the sprockets in the list Calculate gear ratio and set value to ratio Calculate the number of gears and set it to num\_gear Return calculated values  |
