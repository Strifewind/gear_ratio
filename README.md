In bicycle parts and maintenance the chainring and cog are among the most
important components along with the seat and pedals. Using the number of
teeth on the chainring and cog the gear ratio can be determined. A gear
ratio helps identify the rate a riderâ€™s pedaling will match a revolution on
the rear wheel. By changing and selecting the appropriate gear cyclists find
ease on a multitude of terrain. This program calculates the gear ratio by
dividing the number of teeth on the front chainring by the number of teeth
on the rear cog.
